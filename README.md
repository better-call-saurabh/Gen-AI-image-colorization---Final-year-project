# Gen-AI-image-colorization---Final-year-project
#Image Colorization using Deep Learning:
This project demonstrates image colorization using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and can predict colorized versions of grayscale images.
#Features
Dataset: Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
Model Architecture: A CNN model with multiple convolutional layers for extracting features and predicting the RGB color channels from grayscale images.
Training on GPU: The code is optimized to run on GPU if available, significantly speeding up the training process.
#How to Run
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/better-call-saurabh/Gen-AI-image-colorization---Final-year-project/
cd image-colorization
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open colorization_model2.ipynb in Jupyter and execute the cells to train the model.

Training the Model: The model will be trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. You can monitor the training progress and evaluate the model on the test set.

Results
The trained model can colorize grayscale images with a reasonable level of accuracy. The output images will have three color channels (RGB) generated by the model.
